    <title>Axolotl Mileage About</title>

    <p>Hello! I built this app to track my own laps at pools where I swim. I live in Austin, TX, and the pools in the select menu are the ones I go to most often.</p>
    <p>If you swim somewhere besides one of these pools, you can still track your swimming distances! You can choose the option - 'Other' - which will allow you to enter the name and length of the pool. Then you can enter the number of laps you swam.</p>
    <p>Please note that 'Lap' in this case refers to swimming one length of the pool and <i>back</i> to the starting point.</p>
    <p>Right now you can not modify individual fields of a record. You can, however, delete the record by double-clicking or double-tapping the record. Then you can re-enter your swimming data for that day.</p>
    <p>I hope to add filtering functionality in the future so that you can see how many laps and miles you swam within a certain time period.</p>
    <p>If you have any issues with the app or other feedback please send me an email at micha@scrimba.com.</p>
